## ‚öôÔ∏è SQL Steps

We use SQL queries to answer the key business questions:

1. **Explore campaigns & sources**
   - Count distinct campaigns and sources  
   - Map campaign-to-source relationships  
   - List distinct website pages  

2. **Attribution analysis**
   - Attribute **first touches** (earliest campaign per user)  
   - Attribute **last touches** (latest campaign per user)  
   - Count total purchases  
   - Attribute **last touches on purchases** (campaigns driving conversions)
